# Silevis Hackathon Kielce 2022 (24H) - FoodLovers Team - Task Number 7 - FrontEnd
 

Task:<br/>
 Create a system which will allows you to schedule your football meetings in 24 hours.<br/>
**02.12.2022**<br/><br/>



## Summary
The code is not that clean, I know that and I'm not fully proud of it.<br>I did not want to refine it after the hackathon ended - just to show results after alone writing the frontend with that amount of time. <br/>
Menotors and team buddies gave me a lot of support while creating it.<br/>

You can pull FE and BE depos and use the code as it is, **the code is stable and finished.**<br/>

**All of the functionalities** which we discussed before starting coding **were not developed**, sadly we were out of time. <br/>

You can notice how the ending app should look all in the **Figma layout**  mentioned in <b>Authors</b> section.<br/><br/>



## Built with<br/>
 - **React** (class components)<br/>
 - **React Router v6**<br/>
 - **Leaflet** (for easy map and pins management)<br/>
 - **JWT with Cookies** <br/><br/>

## What is done (after 24h)

 - Authorization - simply register, login, logout
 - Events - create or join an event on certain localizations on map.
 - Teams - join to one of the teams
 - Localizations - look for events on location displayed on map  or events which are the closest to you (in time)
 - User roles - depends if you are a capitain (can create events) or regular player (which can only join events).
